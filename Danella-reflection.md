# Reflect GPS 1.1

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	I was struggling with the idea of fetching and merging before the session. We actually ran into some issues with fetching and merging due to me not being within the correct directory. Luckily our guide Alex was able to help us out there. I'm still not totally clear on the process of creating and reviewing pull requests, but I know this will become easier as I get more practice.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
	Fetching, merging, leaving comments within pull requests, resolving merge conficts, and the best practices and strategies to avoid merge conflicts.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
	I asked my pair for his opinion regarding good commit messages, and I asked our guide the same question. He gave us a useful answer saying that each commit message should conver "This commit message will..." and then to add your commit message afterwards. Great piece of advice moving forward.

* What still confuses you about Git?
	There are still certain concepts that I don't necessarily understand in terms of pushing and pulling to and from GitHub. Also, merging and fetching are still somewhat confusing concepts. I still don't really feel comfortable with this and need more practice in order to feel like I totally understand what's happening.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
	Working with Cyzar and Alex was great and gives me a lot of hope for future GPS sessions during Phase 0. It's fun to be able to try and solve problems as a team in real time and utilize the guide as a resource when it's necessary.
