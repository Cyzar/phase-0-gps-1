* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

* I struggled with how to resolving merge conflicts in the local repo with the changes in the master repo on Github. 

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

* When a a branch is merged into master and not deleted, its files stay the same, it is master that integrates all the changes

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

* I asked GPS guide about git practices and conventions and my pair about bash commands

* What still confuses you about Git?

I still don't know how to roll back to a previous version of a file stored in GitHub. For example, if I am ahead locally by a few commits, but I made a lot of mistakes and want to revert to the file on GitHub instead, pull requests from git don't roll back my local repo files. 

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I learned a lot more than I would have on my own and I prefer this learning style because for me to have reinforced these concepts it would have taken a lot longer by myself. I also know that I am more comfortable as a navigator.
